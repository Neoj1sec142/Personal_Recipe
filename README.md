#### Credits:
* Shout out to the GA repos that come in clutch when I'm in panic mode because I forgot what I was doing or I got stuck. And Jermeys new repo he created to help with the axois calls.

#### Directions:
* To create a recipe you have to click the submit button twice    
* To delete you need to copy the id from the recipes page and paste it into the input bar at the top then click the submitt button
* All of the recipes can be viewed on the recieps page
* The update route works on insomnia but seems im still a little confused to this route/function on the back end. Could use more resources.
* Still need to find the correct way to set up the update route front&back

* All that being said, please disregard the extra pages and componenets that are not set up yet. I intend on adding to this and refactoring it more. I want to make this app something for my portfolio but more so something I will actually use.
