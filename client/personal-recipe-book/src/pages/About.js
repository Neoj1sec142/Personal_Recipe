            <p>My idea for this project was to create a place to store and save personal recipes for future use.</p>
            <p>Not just search your average google recipes, I mean the ones you're family/friends passed to you. </p>
            <p>The type of recipes you call you're family recipes, the recipes that need to be perserved.</p>
            <p>That being said, delete my recipes and save your own if you like !! That's the idea!</p>
        </div>
